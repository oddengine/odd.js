This is not only an [HTML5 FLV Player](https://github.com/oddengine/odd.js/blob/master/doc/odd.player.md#roadmap), which supports HTTP/WS-FLV live streaming, but also supports HTTP/WS-fMP4, MPEG-DASH, HLS and other Original HTML5 Media Resources (eg. Ogg, Mpeg4, WebM), with an independent UI framework.  

Note:  

The odd.player.js is now **open-sourced** completely. The Chat plugin which provides Real-Time Video Communication, and the Danmu plugin which works with IM SDK, need a support of [OMS](https://github.com/oddengine/oms).

We've started a new version (v2) for business usage, which is much more professional, high-performance and stable, and compatiable with all of the browsers that supports [MSE](https://caniuse.com/?search=mse), including iPad Safari and Android Chrome. In this build, an UI framework is developed separately from the core SDK (known as API), and is much easier to understand and extend. In the meantime, the UI framework is open-sourced since v2.1.49 to help building customized UI, plugins and components.

The new core SDK provides more professional configurations, interfaces and events. In allusion to entertainment, monitoring, education and VR scenes, it is able to run in **multi-instance** mode and destroy dynamically, detect tracks automatically, synchronize audio and video while missing frames. In addition, configurable time range collector makes it **functional 24/7**. Tying in with **reducing latency due to the cumulative ack of tcp**, the latency of live broadcast can remain low. Besides, it also supports frame capture, progressive fMP4 recording at any time, event reporting of media info, log feedback and so on.

The UI framework is built independently from the core SDK, driven by the interfaces and events. It is designed with multiple scalable and registering plugins, each instance supports **simple skin switching**. Among these plugins, Display and Controlbar provide a flexible way to setup components, such as customization, deleting or re-sorting.

## Example

### Use API directly

```js
var utils = odd.utils,
    events = odd.events,
    Event = events.Event,
    IOEvent = events.IOEvent,
    MediaEvent = events.MediaEvent,
    SaverEvent = events.SaverEvent,
    index = 0;

var api = odd.player();
api.addEventListener(Event.READY, onReady);
api.addEventListener(Event.PLAY, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.LOADSTART, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.WAITING, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.STALLED, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.ABORT, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.TIMEOUT, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.DURATIONCHANGE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.LOADEDMETADATA, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.LOADEDDATA, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.PROGRESS, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.CANPLAY, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.PLAYING, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.CANPLAYTHROUGH, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.SUSPEND, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.PAUSE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.SEEKING, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.SEEKED, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.SWITCHING, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.SWITCHED, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.RATECHANGE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.TIMEUPDATE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.VOLUMECHANGE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.LOAD, console.log);
api.addEventListener(MediaEvent.INFOCHANGE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(MediaEvent.STATSUPDATE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(MediaEvent.SEI, console.log);
api.addEventListener(MediaEvent.SCREENSHOT, onScreenshot);
api.addEventListener(SaverEvent.WRITERSTART, console.log);
api.addEventListener(SaverEvent.WRITEREND, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.ENDED, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.ERROR, console.error);
api.setup(container, {
    file: 'http://127.0.0.1/vod/sample.flv',
});

function onReady(e) {
    // ui.record('fragmented.mp4');
}

function onScreenshot(e) {
    var arr = e.data.image.split(',');
    var ret = arr[0].match(/^data:(image\/(.+));base64$/);
    if (ret === null) {
        console.error('The string did not match the expected pattern.');
        return;
    }

    var link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = e.data.image;
    link.download = 'screenshot-' + utils.padStart(index++, 3, '0') + '.' + ret[2];
    link.click();
}
```

### Use the built-in extendible UI framework

```js
var events = odd.events,
    Event = events.Event,
    UIEvent = events.UIEvent,
    MouseEvent = events.MouseEvent;

var ui = odd.player.ui(0, { mode: 'file' });
ui.addEventListener(Event.READY, onReady);
ui.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, onClick);
ui.addEventListener(UIEvent.SHOOTING, console.log);
ui.addEventListener(UIEvent.FULLPAGE, console.log);
ui.addEventListener(UIEvent.FULLSCREEN, console.log);
ui.addEventListener(UIEvent.RESIZE, console.log);
ui.setup(container, {
    ...
    service: {
        script: 'js/sw.js',
        scope: 'js/',
        enable: false,
    },
});

function onReady(e) {
    // ui.record('fragmented.mp4');
}

function onClick(e) {
    switch (e.data.name) {
        case 'report':
            ui.logger.flush();
            break;
    }
}
```

### Add Callback

```js
api.onready = function(e) {
    // do something
};
```

Or:

```js
api.addEventListener('ready', onReady);

function onReady(e) {
    // do something
}
```
