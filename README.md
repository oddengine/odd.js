This is a HTML5 Video Player for modern media streaming.  

Note:  

The open-sourced version (v1.2) is no longer being maintained. You can still find the source under branch "v1.2.xx". But it is outdated and not recommended to use in productions.

Instead, we've started a new version (v2) for business usage, which is much more professional, efficient and stable. In this build, an UI framework is developed separately from the core SDK which is named as API, and is much easier to understand and extend. The UI framework is open-sourced since v2.1.49 to help building customized UI, plugins and components.

If you are interested in this player, please contact for details.

## Roadmap

### Core Modules

- [x] SRC (original html5 media resources, eg. Ogg, Mpeg4, WebM, etc.)  
- [x] FLV (http[s]/ws[s])  
- [ ] FMP4 (http[s]/ws[s])  
- [ ] DASH (ll-cmaf)  
- [ ] HLS (ll-cmaf)  
- [ ] RTC  
- [ ] ~~Flash~~  

### UI Plugins

- [x] Poster  
- [x] v2.1.00 - Danmu  
- [x] Display  
- [ ] AD  
- [ ] Share  
- [x] Logo  
- [x] Controlbar  
- [x] ContextMenu  
- [ ] Playlist  

### Features

- [x] v2.0.89 - Synchronize video with audio while some frames are missing.  
- [x] v2.1.07 - Carry api.id while dispatching events.  
- [x] v2.1.10 - Remove media segments within a specific time range to release memory usage.  
- [x] v2.1.20 - Capture the current frame, and save as a picture.

## Example

### Use the SDK directly

```js
var utils = playease.utils,
    events = playease.events,
    Event = events.Event,
    IOEvent = events.IOEvent,
    MediaEvent = events.MediaEvent,
    SaverEvent = events.SaverEvent,
    index = 0;

var api = playease();
api.addEventListener(Event.READY, onReady);
api.addEventListener(Event.PLAY, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.LOADSTART, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.WAITING, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.STALLED, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.ABORT, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.TIMEOUT, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.DURATIONCHANGE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.LOADEDMETADATA, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.LOADEDDATA, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.PROGRESS, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.CANPLAY, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.PLAYING, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.CANPLAYTHROUGH, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.SUSPEND, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.PAUSE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.SEEKING, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.SEEKED, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.SWITCHING, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.SWITCHED, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.RATECHANGE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.TIMEUPDATE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.VOLUMECHANGE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(IOEvent.LOAD, console.log);
api.addEventListener(MediaEvent.INFOCHANGE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(MediaEvent.STATSUPDATE, console.log);
api.addEventListener(MediaEvent.SEI, console.log);
api.addEventListener(MediaEvent.SCREENSHOT, onScreenshot);
api.addEventListener(SaverEvent.WRITERSTART, console.log);
api.addEventListener(SaverEvent.WRITEREND, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.ENDED, console.log);
api.addEventListener(Event.ERROR, console.error);
api.setup(container, {
    file: 'http://127.0.0.1/vod/sample.flv',
});

function onReady(e) {
    // ui.record('sample.mp4');
}

function onScreenshot(e) {
    var arr = e.data.image.split(',');
    var ret = arr[0].match(/^data:(image\/(.+));base64$/);
    if (ret === null) {
        console.error('The string did not match the expected pattern.');
        return;
    }

    var link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = e.data.image;
    link.download = 'screenshot-' + utils.padStart(index++, 3, '0') + '.' + ret[2];
    link.click();
}
```

### Use the built-in extendible UI framework

```js
var events = playease.events,
    Event = events.Event,
    UIEvent = events.UIEvent,
    MouseEvent = events.MouseEvent;

var ui = playease.ui();
ui.addEventListener(Event.READY, onReady);
ui.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, onClick);
ui.addEventListener(UIEvent.SHOOTING, console.log);
ui.addEventListener(UIEvent.FULLPAGE, console.log);
ui.addEventListener(UIEvent.FULLSCREEN, console.log);
ui.addEventListener(UIEvent.RESIZE, console.log);
ui.setup(container, {
    ...
    service: {
        script: 'js/sw.js',
        scope: 'js/',
        enable: true,
    },
});

function onReady(e) {
    // ui.record('sample.mp4');
}

function onClick(e) {
    switch (e.data.name) {
        case 'report':
            if (playease.LOGGER) {
                utils.logger.save();
            }
            break;
    }
}
```

### Add Callback

```js
api.onready = function(e) {
    // do something
};
```

Or:

```js
api.addEventListener('ready', onReady);

function onReady(e) {
    // do something
}
```

## Configuration

## API

### Statics of SDK

| Method | Arguments | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| get | id = 0 | Gets the SDK instance by id, create one if it doesn't exist. |
| create |  | Creates an API instance with an auto-increased id, or return the one already exist. |

Note:

> playease(id) is short for playease.API.get(id).  
> playease.create() is short for playease.API.create().  

### API of SDK Instance

| Method | Arguments | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| setup | container, config | Setup the SDK with the given configuration. |
| play | url = '', options = null | Plays the specified media file or live stream, or the current item of the sources if the url doesn't provided. |
| pause |  | Pauses playing. Calling this method does nothing if the video is already paused. |
| seek | offset | Seeks the keyframe (also called an I-frame in the video industry) closest to the specified location. |
| stop |  | Stops playing, sets the time property to 0. |
| reload |  | Releases all the resources, reloads the media file or live stream. |
| muted | status | Mutes or unmutes the audio/video elements, if status is a boolean. Otherwise, returns the current status. |
| volume | f | Sets volume, which in the range of 0 to 1, if f is a number. Otherwise, returns the current volume. |
| definition | index | Switches to the specified definition, if index is a number. Otherwise, returns the current definition. |
| capture | width, height, mime | Captures the current frame, dispatches an screenshot event, and returns the image. |

| element |  | Gets the current rendering element, such as video, flash, canvas, etc. |
| duration |  | Gets the media duration. |
| state |  | Gets the player state. |
| destroy |  | Destroy this instance, removes dom elements. |

### Statics of UI

| create |  | Create an UI instance with an auto-increment id, or return the one already exist. |

Note:

> playease.ui(id) is short for playease.UI.get(id).
